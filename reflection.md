- What are your initial impressions of how `Association` affectes your programming?
I think it's helpful for organization, to only do a little bit at a time, and to not necessarily have to make every aspect work for something to work. There's still conceptually something that doesn't really click though, but I'm not sure what it is. I think I just need more practice.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
It was fun to play with the ASCI art because I'd never done it before. I'd recommend having something you think is enjoyable to look at in some way! 
I read over step 4 a bunch of times and tried to implement it but I never quite figured out how it all connected (Banner, message, sign, String args[], etc.). 
I also played around a lot with println() vs print() for the left/right boots, but ultimately decided it was going to be more complicated than I wanted it to be, and I had already drawn the boots, so I switched left and right to top and bottom.
